# Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

1. Download an IDE and understand what it is.
2. Fork this repository and contribute back to your fork.
3. Identify and understand variables, functions and exceptions.
4. Test and debug a program.
5. Evaluate solutions that already exist.

# Integrated Development Environments

IDEs are text editors with tools for testing and debugging your program in the same application.

For simplicity we will be using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=mac).

Pycharm creates a virtual environment for each project it opens.  You can install packages into it from the IDE terminal.  You can also use an existing virtual environment.  The Python that is used by the IDE appears on the lower-right hand corner of the application and can be adjusted accordingly there.

You need to install the requirements in requirements.txt under the sample folder in the IDE's virtual environment to complete this lesson.
